# Summary

UPDATE
For those of you who have problems with printing the pressTable.stl, please try the updated file. Happy printing!



Open Press Project is the first 3D-printed etching press ... and won‘t be the last! 

Everyone that has access to a 3D printer can produce their own fully functional DIY press and print their own etchings, dry-points or engravings. Woodcuts, linocuts and other relief printing techniques work, too!

With only 5 € of material costs it is also the world’s most inexpensive press! All you need to know about your first print is summarized here: https://openpressproject.com/project/printapress

This is the outcome of my Intermediate-exam at KISD Köln International School of Design. After about 7 years of printmaking at Kölner Graphikwerkstatt (http://www.graphikwerkstatt.de/) I thought I should give the world a press that is not as expensive, heavy and huge like any other printmaking press. I figured that the unavailability of a press is one of the main challenges for people that want to try printmaking. That's why I decided to create one with my 3D-printer! Over the course of 5 months I built 10 prototypes, printed more than 100 proofs and used a kilometer of filament. And I got it working! The final prototype is able to print on a 70 x 100 mm paper!

All of the files are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License, so you're free to copy, share, and edit the press for non-commercial purposes. I would love to see your redesigns, adjustments and improvements to the press! After more than 300 years of nonexisting innovation in the design of a printmaking press it's time to bring it to the next level.

To start printing you have to download the 3D files! For detailed instructions please visit: https://openpressproject.com/project/printapress

Happy printing!
